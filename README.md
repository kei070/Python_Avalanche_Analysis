# Avalanche Analysis

These script were written for the data analysis supporting the paper "Predicting avalanche risk in northern Norway from expert risk assessments using statistical models".

To make the scripts work on your system in each individual script the paths must be adjusted.

The scripts in ts_KUE are either copied or derived from the metocean-api (https://github.com/MET-OM/metocean-api).
